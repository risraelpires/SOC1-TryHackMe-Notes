# MITRE FRAMEWORK - TryHackMe SOC1 

# CORE ELEMENTS
MITRE ATT&CK - globally-accesible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations 
 * EST 2013 - security professionals were selected to emulate adversarial TTP's against a network - data collected to construct ATT&CK framework
- Often associated with CVE's (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) list [public catalog for finding an exploit for a given vulnerability]

APT - Advanced Persistent Threat
 * Threat Group - team/group
 * Nation-State Group 
   = engage in long-term attacks against organizations and/or countries 

TTP - Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
 * Tactic - adversary's objectice
 * Technique - how the adversary achieves the objective
 * Procedure - how the technique is executed

# MITRE RESOURCES
    * ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework
    * CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository) Knowledge Base
    * ENGAGE
    * D3FEND (Detection, Denial, and Disruption Framework Empowering Network Defense) 

# NAVIGATING THROUGH ATT&CK FRAMEWORK
Hikit - malware (used by Axiom) for late-stage persistence and exfiltration after initial compromise
Mitigation for Phishing = User Training
Detection Data Sources = Application, File, Network Traffic

# CAR KNOWLEDGE BASE (CAR)
CAR - Cyber Analytics Repository - knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on ATT&CK adversary model
 * Validated & explained analytics - data models leveraged in pseudocode and implementations targeted at specific tools 
   - Pseudocode - plain, human-readable way to descrive a set of instructions (program) that a program or system will perform
   - Masquerading - technique for running executables with the same hash and different names

# MITRE ENGAGE
MITRE Engage - framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations - engage your adversaries - implements Cyber Denial & Cyber Deception
 * Cyber Denial - prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations
 * Cyber Deception - plant artifacts to mislead the adversary
[MITRE Engage provides a 'starter kit' that consists of a collection of whitepapers and PDFs]

 * Threat Model - a risk assessment that models organizational strengths and weaknesses

# MITRE D3FEND
MITE D3FEND - knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures - BETA - NSA
 * Provides definitions, explanations of how they work, considerations, examples, and digital artifact relationships
- Adversary Emulation Library - public library making adversary emulation plans for blue/red teamers 

# ATT&CK EMULATION PLANS
Center of Threat-Informed Defense (CTID) - organization formed by MITRE - various companies & vendors around the globe conducting research on cyber threats and their TTPs

# THREAT INTELLIGENCE
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) or Threat Intelligence (TI) - information or TTPs attributed to the adversary - for the sole purpose of making better decisions for defensive strategy 
- Gathering TI can serve as a checklist to ensure proper security coverage, and to know which APT groups may target a specific sector

# RECAP
Explored the various tools and resources MITRE offers - more information as defenders = better equipped for defense 

# NEW TERMS LEARNED:
   - Masquerading 
   - Cyber Denial
   - Cyber Deception
