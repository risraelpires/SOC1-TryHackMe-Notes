# CYBER THREAT INTEL  - TryHackMe SOC1  

# CORE ELEMENTS
The SOC Level 1 Analyst's position in the Security Operations Centre: the first human touchpoint for suspicious pings, pop-ups, or packets
* Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) - the process of collecting, analyzing, and applying data about cyber threats to proactively defend against threats
* Telemetry - the automated collection, analysis, and reporting of data from various sources like endpoints, networks, and applications. Providing real-time visibility into security posture
  = enriching indicators, triaging alerts, and turning raw data into stories
* Triaging - sorting, prioritizing, and investigating security alerts to identify real threats and effective incident response
  --> Alert Response: Ticket Queues

Threat Intelligence provides the context for analyst to help discern which alerts represent genuine danger
 (3) Essential Questions that CTI seeks to answer:
  * Who, or what, is on the other end of this alert indicator?
  * What was their behaviour in the past?
  * How does my organization respond, and what should I do about it right now?

CTI is the front-line tool that elevates SOC triage from guesswork to calculated action

# ESSENTIAL VOCABULARY| EXAMPLES |SOCL1 RESPONSE
  - Data - an unprocessed observable | '45.155.205.3 :443' | Capture the artefact
  - Information - data plus factual annotation | 'IP registered to Hetzner, first seen 2023-07-14' | Record attributes
  - Intelligence - analyzed information that answers | 'IP belongs to the current BumbleBee C2; block immediately' | Escalate or suppress

# DATA TO INTELLIGENCE
  --> Making artifacts usable to qualify them as intelligence or prove they never will.
* Enrichment - rapid, methodical lookups of public, commercial, and internal sources that provide evidence of origin, behavior, and relevance
* Indicator of Compromise (IOC) - evidence of a breach | C2 address in logs
* Indicator of Attack (IOA) - a malicious action | PowerShell launching an unknown service
* Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) - adversary's detailed methodologies (MITRE ATT&CK)

* TIP - maintain a bookmarked browser folder or SIEM launcher panel that opens preferred look-ups with highlighted indicators pre-populated *

# FEEDS V PLATFORMS
  - Feed: a scheduled stream of indicators, usually delivered in various formats (CSV,JSON,STIX,TAXII)
  - Platform: a structured repository that stores indicators, tracks enrichment, maps relationships, and enforces sharing permissions (MISP, OPENCTI)
 
# SOURCES OF CTI
  - Internal telemetry - SIEM logs, EDR detections, phishing-mailbox submissions
  - Commercial services: Vendor premium feeds, paid sandboxes**,** and closed-source analytics 
  - Open-source intelligence (OSINT): AbuseIPDB, URLhaus, public blogs with IOCs, and academic research
  - Communities & ISACs: Sector-specific lists marked with labels and rich context (e.g., FS-ISAC)

# CTI LIFECYCLE
  1) Planning & Direction - primary asset, business risk, available controls, initial CTI goal
  2) Collection - assembling the raw material
  3) Processing - normalizing and correlating the data
  4) Analysis - turning information into judgement
  5) Dissemination - getting intelligence to the right consumers
  6) Feedback - measuring and refining the cycle

# CTI STANDARDS & FRAMEWORKS
  - MITRE ATT&CK - how adversaries attack
  - MITRE D3F3ND - how defenders respond
  - Cyber Kill Chain - adversary actions in steps
  - CVEs, CVSS, and the NVD - discovered vulnerabilities, severity rating, relationship between them 
  - STIX - structured JSON schema for threat information
  - TAXII - secure APIs to exchange threat intelligence in near real-time for detection, prevention and for threat mitigation

# PRACTICAL ANALYSIS
 --> Used a SIEM dashboard for identifying and organizing threat intel:
    * (Source) Threat Actor email address: vipivillain@badbank.com
    * (Downloaded) File Name: flbpfuh.exe
    * Threat Actor Extraction IP Address: 91.185.23.222
    * Victim Email Recipient: John Doe
    * User Victim Logged Account: Administrator
    * Malware Tool: flbpfuh.exe

# RECAP
These notes serve as a general outline of the various resources and tools used in the SOC environment. Consisting of general descriptions, definitions, standards & frameworks,
and other forms of reference for the general duties of a SOC1 Analyst. This allows me to have an organized repository of tools to know and learn for my future career in Cybersecurity.
