# SOC1 – TryHackMe Tracebook

# Objective
Document and analyze simulated adversary behavior across the SOC1 pathway using modular, forensic notes and trace logic. Each folder represents a core module or lab engagement.

# Structure
* SOC1-THM-Tracebook/
* ├── Cyber Defence Frameworks/ ├── Diamond-Model/ ├── MITRE/ ├── Summit - Threat Simulation & Detection Engineering/ ├──
* ├── Cyber Threat Intelligence/ ├── Intro/ ├──
* ├── Templates/ ├── Repo/ ├──
* └── README.md

# Note-Taking Strategy
Each concept or lab is documented using structured blocks:
- **# CORE ELEMENTS** - Fundamental Concepts
- **# TOOLS USED** - Cybersecurity Tools
- **# (FOCUSED CONCEPTS)** - Walk-Throughs, Configurations, Troubleshooting, etc..
- **# RECAP** - Summary
- **# NEW TERMS LEARNED** -Documented vocabulary and synonyms

# Tools Used
- Sigma Rule Builder
- Sysmon
- Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit
